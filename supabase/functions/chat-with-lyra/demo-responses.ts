${greeting}ready to see how AI transforms fundraising data?

This interactive demo shows you step-by-step how AI finds hidden patterns and creates actionable insights from messy data.

We'll use sample data so you can see the magic without any setup.

*Click "Start Demo" below to begin your journey into AI-powered insights.*`;

    case 'loading':
      return `**Step 1: Data Processing**

${greeting}watch as our AI system loads and processes realistic fundraising data.

Notice how it handles the messy, real-world data that would typically overwhelm traditional analysis tools.

**Real-time Data Processing:**
- Parsing 1,247 donor records across multiple formats
- Standardizing inconsistent data entries
- Cross-referencing engagement metrics
- Validating data integrity and completeness

**Data Cleaning Operations:**
- Normalizing name variations (M. Chen → Michael Chen)
- Converting currency formats ($245.00, $89, etc.)
- Standardizing date formats across systems
- Flagging incomplete or suspicious records

**Processing Speed:** What would take a human analyst 4-6 hours to clean and organize, AI completes in under 30 seconds.

This is just the beginning. The real magic happens in the analysis phase.`;

    case 'analysis':
      return `**Step 2: Advanced AI Analysis**
