# Interactive Element Engagement Standards

## Core Engagement Principles

### 1. Multi-Phase Journey Structure
Every interactive element must follow a progressive disclosure pattern with distinct phases:

- **Phase 1: Story Hook** - Character struggle introduction (10-15 seconds)
- **Phase 2: Interactive Building** - User constructs solution (2-3 minutes)
- **Phase 3: Preview/Application** - See results in action (30-60 seconds)
- **Phase 4: Success Celebration** - Acknowledge mastery with metrics (15-30 seconds)

### 2. Emotional Connection Requirements
- Each element MUST connect to character's specific challenge
- Show quantifiable before/after transformation
- Include personal testimonial or quote
- Demonstrate relatable pain points

### 3. Interaction Complexity Spectrum

#### Low Complexity (50-100 combinations)
- 2-3 decision layers
- 5-10 options per layer
- Suitable for: Quick tools, simple generators

#### Medium Complexity (100-500 combinations)
- 3-4 decision layers
- 5-10 options per layer
- Suitable for: Document builders, communication tools

#### High Complexity (500+ combinations)
- 4-5 decision layers
- 8-12 options per layer
- Suitable for: Comprehensive builders, strategy tools

### 4. Practical Value Metrics
Every element must demonstrate:
- **Time Saved**: Concrete before/after comparison
- **Quality Improvement**: Measurable enhancement metric
- **Immediate Applicability**: Copy/download/apply functionality
- **Reusability**: Templates or saved configurations

### 5. Visual Feedback Requirements

#### Real-Time Indicators
- Progress bars or step counters
- Layer completion checkmarks
- Preview updates as user builds
- Hover states on all interactive elements

#### Success Indicators
- Completion animations
- Achievement badges
- Score or rating displays
- Time saved visualizations

### 6. Story Integration Checklist
- [ ] Element directly solves character's stated problem
- [ ] Timeline matches lesson narrative
- [ ] Outcome feeds into next lesson's setup
- [ ] User can map to their own situation

### 7. Engagement Validation Metrics
Minimum requirements for completion:
- **Time on Task**: 2-5 minutes
- **Interactions**: At least 3 meaningful choices
- **Completion Rate Target**: 80%+
- **Retry Willingness**: Users should want to try different combinations

### 8. Copy and Application Features
- One-click copy functionality
- Download options where applicable
- Email or share capabilities
- Save for later functionality
