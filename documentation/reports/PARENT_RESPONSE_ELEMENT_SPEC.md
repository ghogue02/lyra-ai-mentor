## User Journey

### 1. **Emotional Setup** 
Users see Sarah's urgent email displayed like a real email client:

```
From: Sarah Chen <sarahchen@email.com>
Subject: Urgent - Program Changes?
Time: Monday 8:47 AM

Hi Maya,

I just saw the notice about the new 5:30 PM pickup time starting next 
month. As a single parent working until 6 PM downtown, I'm really 
concerned about how this will work for Emma and me. 

She loves the program and her friends there. Is there any flexibility? 
I'm worried she'll have to drop out, and I don't know what I'll do for 
childcare. Can we talk about options?

I'm feeling pretty stressed about this.

Thanks,
Sarah Chen
```

**Emotional Context Box**: 
> 💭 Maya's Thoughts: "Sarah never emails unless something's really wrong. I can feel her stress. Emma would be devastated to leave the program. I need to help, but how do I balance empathy with our policies?"

### 2. **Scaffolded Template Interface**

│ • Connection to our parent carpool network - several   │
│   families work downtown                                │
│ • Work-study opportunity where Emma could help with    │
│   younger children (builds leadership skills!)          │
│                                                         │

"Maya, I can't tell you how relieved I am! When I sent 
that email this morning, I was in such a panic. Your 
response made me feel heard and gave me real options.

The extended care program sounds perfect - I had no idea 
it was so affordable. And I love the idea of connecting 
with other downtown parents for backup coverage.

Thank you for caring about Emma and our family. This is 
why we love Hope Gardens so much.

Can we talk tomorrow afternoon?"

✨ Lyra: Wow, Maya! That was masterful communication! 

What you just did:
🎯 Validated feelings BEFORE explaining = instant trust
🎯 Used "solution sandwich" = acknowledge→explain→solve  
🎯 Offered 3 options = transformed anxiety into agency
🎯 Kept it warm AND professional = perfect balance

💡 Pro tip: Save this as a template! You'll face similar 
schedule concerns again. The pattern works for any 
difficult news: validate→explain→solve→partner.
