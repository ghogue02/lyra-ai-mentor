## Next Steps

### 1. Update Main Routing
Add to your main App.tsx or routing file:
```tsx
import { ChapterRoutes } from '@/components/chapter/chapter-routes'

// In your routes
<Route path="/chapter/*" element={<ChapterRoutes />} />
```

### 2. Update Dashboard Navigation
Modify dashboard to link to `/chapter/2` instead of individual lessons

### 3. Add Interactive Elements
For Lessons 6, 7, and 8, create story-driven components like MayaParentResponseEmail:
- `MayaGrantProposal.tsx`
- `MayaBoardMeetingPrep.tsx`
- `MayaResearchSynthesis.tsx`

### 4. Run the Transformation
```bash
# Run the complete transformation
npx tsx scripts/run-chapter2-transformation.ts

# Or run individual scripts:
npx tsx scripts/content-audit-tool.ts
npx tsx scripts/cleanup-chapter2.ts
```

### 5. Extend to Other Chapters
Use the same architecture for:
- Chapter 3: Sofia's storytelling journey
- Chapter 4: David's data journey
- Chapter 5: Rachel's automation journey
- Chapter 6: Alex's leadership journey

## Key Design Decisions

### Navigation Philosophy
- **Sequential unlocking**: Complete lessons in order to maintain story flow
- **Story continuity**: Each lesson ends with a hook to the next
- **Progress visualization**: Users see their journey through Maya's transformation

### Component Naming Convention
- Character-based: `Maya[Feature][Purpose]`
- Examples: `MayaEmailResponse`, `MayaGrantProposal`
- Folder structure: `/chapters/chapter2-maya/`

### Content Principles
- **Single character focus**: All of Chapter 2 follows Maya
- **Emotional journey**: Each lesson has struggle â†’ discovery â†’ victory
- **Practical application**: Every interactive element solves a real problem
- **Cumulative learning**: Skills build on each other

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Clear Learning Path**: Users follow Maya's complete transformation
2. **Emotional Investment**: Single character creates deeper connection
3. **Practical Skills**: Each lesson teaches immediately applicable tools
4. **Flexible Extension**: Easy to add new chapters with different characters
5. **Progress Tracking**: Users see their journey visually
6. **Reusable Components**: Navigation system works for all chapters
