Dear [Restaurant Owner Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name] from [Organization Name], a non-profit dedicated to addressing food insecurity in Staten Island.

I'm reaching out because we admire [Restaurant Name]'s commitment to our community, and I believe we share a common goal of ensuring no neighbor goes hungry.

Partnership Proposal:
We're seeking restaurant partners to donate surplus food that would otherwise go to waste. This food would go directly to families in need through our meal distribution program.

Benefits to [Restaurant Name]:
‚Ä¢ Tax-deductible donations
‚Ä¢ Reduced food waste disposal costs
‚Ä¢ Positive community impact and PR
‚Ä¢ Monthly impact reports showing your contribution

We currently serve 300+ families weekly and your participation would help us expand our reach.

Would you be available for a brief 15-minute call next week to discuss this opportunity? I'm confident we can create a partnership that works seamlessly with your operations.

Thank you for considering this opportunity to make a difference together.

Sincerely,

Hi [Restaurant Owner Name]!

I'm [Your Name] from [Organization Name], and I have an idea that I think you'll love.

Every week, we see families in Staten Island struggling to put food on the table. Meanwhile, great restaurants like yours sometimes have perfectly good food that doesn't get sold. What if we could connect the dots?

Here's my simple proposal:
‚Ä¢ You donate surplus food (whatever works for you)
‚Ä¢ We pick it up on your schedule
‚Ä¢ Families get nutritious meals
‚Ä¢ You get tax benefits + amazing karma! 

No pressure, no complicated contracts ‚Äì just neighbors helping neighbors.

Plus, imagine telling your customers that their favorite restaurant is helping feed local families. Talk about a win-win! 

Got 15 minutes next week for a quick coffee chat? I'd love to hear your thoughts and answer any questions.

Looking forward to potentially partnering with you!

Cheers,
[Your Name]`;
