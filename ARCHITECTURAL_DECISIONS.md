# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
*System Architecture Designer - Final Decisions Summary*

## ADR-001: Single Source of Truth State Management

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Current system has duplicate state management between `FloatingLyraAvatar` and `ContextualLyraChat`, causing synchronization issues and race conditions.

### Decision
Implement centralized state management using React Context + useReducer pattern with a single ChatState object.

### Rationale
- Eliminates state synchronization bugs
- Provides single source of truth for all chat-related state
- Enables predictable state transitions
- Supports time-travel debugging and state persistence

### Consequences
- **Positive:** No more duplicate state, predictable updates, easier debugging
- **Negative:** Initial migration complexity, learning curve for team
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation and gradual migration strategy

## ADR-002: RequestAnimationFrame-Based Narrative Engine

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Current typewriter effect in `NarrativeManager` has race conditions when paused/resumed, causing stuck cursors and inconsistent behavior.

### Decision
Replace setTimeout/setInterval-based animation with RequestAnimationFrame (RAF) approach.

### Rationale
- RAF provides smooth, frame-rate-independent animation
- Natural pause/resume support without race conditions
- Better performance and battery efficiency
- Automatic throttling when tab is inactive

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Smooth 60 FPS animation, no stuck cursors, pause-safe operation
- **Negative:** Slightly more complex implementation
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing and fallback mechanisms

## ADR-003: Modular Lesson Integration System

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Different lessons require different chat behaviors, contextual questions, and narrative flows. Current system tightly couples lesson logic with chat components.

### Decision
Implement a modular lesson system with pluggable modules and dynamic loading.

### Rationale
- Clean separation of concerns between chat system and lesson logic
- Easy addition of new lesson types
- Code splitting for better performance
- Testable and maintainable lesson-specific code

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Scalable architecture, easy lesson development, code splitting benefits
- **Negative:** Additional complexity in module registration and loading
- **Mitigation:** Simple module interface, comprehensive examples, and fallback modules

## ADR-004: Performance-First Component Architecture

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Current system has performance issues with unnecessary re-renders and memory leaks in narrative management.

### Decision
Implement performance-optimized component architecture with selective memoization and efficient selectors.

### Rationale
- React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Selector pattern for efficient state subscriptions
- Proper cleanup of timers, intervals, and event listeners
- Memory management for long-running sessions

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Smooth 60 FPS performance, reduced memory usage, better battery life
- **Negative:** More complex component optimization patterns
- **Mitigation:** Performance monitoring tools and automated testing

## ADR-005: Backwards Compatibility During Migration

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Need to migrate existing lesson components without breaking functionality or requiring simultaneous updates across the entire codebase.

### Decision
Implement backwards compatibility layer with feature flags for gradual migration.

### Rationale
- Reduces risk of breaking existing functionality
- Allows incremental testing and validation
- Provides instant rollback capability
- Enables parallel development of new features

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Safe migration path, reduced deployment risk, team productivity maintained
- **Negative:** Temporary code duplication and complexity
- **Mitigation:** Clear migration timeline and automated cleanup of legacy code

## ADR-006: Minimal, Magical User Interface Design

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Current interface feels like "customer service" rather than a magical learning companion. Users want minimal, delightful interactions.

### Decision
Design principles focused on magical, minimal interface with contextual intelligence.

### Rationale
- Removes customer service feel through subtle animations and smart behavior
- Contextual suggestions based on lesson progress
- Gentle notifications without interruption
- Focus on delightful micro-interactions

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Improved user experience, higher engagement, magical feeling
- **Negative:** More complex animation and interaction design
- **Mitigation:** User testing and iterative refinement

## ADR-007: TypeScript Strict Mode for Type Safety

**Status:** APPROVED  
**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Deciders:** System_Architect (Hive Mind Coordination)

### Context
Need robust type safety for complex state management and module system to prevent runtime errors.

### Decision
Use TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type definitions for all components.

### Rationale
- Prevents runtime errors through compile-time checking
- Excellent developer experience with IntelliSense
- Self-documenting code through type definitions
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Fewer bugs, better developer experience, easier maintenance
- **Negative:** Initial setup time for comprehensive types
- **Mitigation:** Gradual type adoption and comprehensive examples
