**The Situation:**
Sarah Chen, a single parent working until 6 PM downtown, just learned about the new 5:30 PM pickup time. She's stressed and worried her daughter Emma will have to drop out of your after-school program.

**Your Mission:**
Help Maya write a response that turns this moment of anxiety into a deeper connection with Sarah's family.

**Scaffolded Approach:**
1. **Start with Understanding** - Acknowledge Sarah's concern with genuine warmth
2. **Explain with Transparency** - Share the reason for changes without defensiveness  
3. **Offer Concrete Options** - Present practical solutions that show you care
4. **End with Partnership** - Reinforce Emma's value and suggest next steps

**Available Solutions:**
‚Ä¢ Extended care until 6:30 PM ($5/day, sliding scale available)
‚Ä¢ Parent carpool network for downtown families
‚Ä¢ Work-study option where Emma helps with younger children

**Tone Guide:** Warm & Understanding - Like a supportive friend who happens to run a program

**Success Criteria:** Sarah should feel heard, have clear options, and know that Maya truly cares about keeping Emma in the program.

üí° As you write, notice how AI transforms your natural empathy into polished, professional communication!`

      originalMessage: `Hi Maya,

I just saw the notice about the new 5:30 PM pickup time starting next month. As a single parent working until 6 PM downtown, I'm really concerned about how this will work for Emma and me. 

She loves the program and her friends there. Is there any flexibility? I'm worried she'll have to drop out, and I don't know what I'll do for childcare. Can we talk about options?

I'm feeling pretty stressed about this.

Thanks,
Sarah Chen`
