Sarah Chen, a parent whose daughter Emma attends the after-school program, has sent a concerned email about the new pickup schedule that was announced last week.

Sarah's message is polite but clearly worried: "I just saw the notice about the new 5:30 PM pickup time. As a single parent working until 6 PM downtown, I'm really concerned about how this will work for Emma and me. Is there any flexibility? I don't want her to lose her spot in the program..."

This is exactly the kind of email that usually takes Maya 30 minutes to craft - she needs to balance empathy for Sarah's situation, clearly explain the reasons for the change, offer practical solutions, and maintain professional boundaries while keeping that warm, personal touch parents appreciate.

In the past, Maya would have stared at the blank screen, typed and deleted several openings, worried about sounding too rigid or too casual, and probably put it off until after lunch.
