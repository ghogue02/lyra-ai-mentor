David knows that tone. It is the same polite dismissal he has heard from twelve funders this year.

Rachel, these systems are impressive, board chair Margaret Chen says carefully, but we are concerned you have lost sight of our mission. Community centers are about human connection, not technological efficiency.

Rachel''s heart sinks. She has saved the organization 40 hours per week of administrative work â€“ time their small staff can now spend on direct client services.

We are fighting systems that increasingly use AI against the people we serve, argues organizing director Carmen Santos. Adopting these same tools feels like collaboration with oppression.
