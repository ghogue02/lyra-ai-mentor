## 2. Maya Journey Integration Points

### A. Pre-Chat Integration Triggers

#### 2.1 Narrative Pause Points
Strategic moments where Maya's story naturally invites interaction:

```typescript
const mayaNarrativeTriggers = [
  {
    storyPoint: "maya-overwhelm-introduction",
    triggerText: "Maya stares at her overflowing inbox...",
    chatPrompt: "Have you ever felt overwhelmed by email like Maya?",
    integrationPoint: "emotional-connection",
    expectedEngagement: "high"
  },
  {
    storyPoint: "pace-framework-discovery",
    triggerText: "Maya discovers the PACE framework...",
    chatPrompt: "Want to learn the PACE framework that transformed Maya's approach?",
    integrationPoint: "methodology-learning",
    expectedEngagement: "high"
  },
  {
    storyPoint: "first-donor-success",
    triggerText: "Maya's first PACE-structured email gets a response...",
    chatPrompt: "How could you apply Maya's approach to your donor communications?",
    integrationPoint: "practical-application",
    expectedEngagement: "medium"
  }
];
```

#### 2.2 Interactive Decision Points
Moments where users can influence Maya's journey:

```typescript
const mayaDecisionPoints = [
  {
    decisionId: "donor-approach-choice",
    context: "Maya must choose how to approach her major donor email",
    options: [
      {
        id: "formal-approach",
        text: "Use formal, institutional tone",
        outcome: "professional-but-distant"
      },
      {
        id: "personal-approach", 
        text: "Use warm, personal tone",
        outcome: "engaging-and-effective"
      }
    ],
    chatIntegration: "post-decision-reflection"
  }
];
```

### B. Contextual Chat Activation

#### 2.3 Progressive Disclosure Pattern
Chat availability increases as users progress through Maya's journey:

```typescript
const chatAvailabilityStages = {
  "introduction": {
    available: false,
    reason: "Let users connect with Maya's story first"
  },
  "problem-identification": {
    available: true,
    focusAreas: ["email-challenges", "time-management"],
    triggerIntensity: "subtle"
  },
  "solution-exploration": {
    available: true,
    focusAreas: ["pace-framework", "ai-tools", "templates"],
    triggerIntensity: "moderate"
  },
  "practical-application": {
    available: true,
