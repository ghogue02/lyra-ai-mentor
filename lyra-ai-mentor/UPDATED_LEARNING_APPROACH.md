# üéØ **UPDATED LEARNING APPROACH: MICRO-LEARNING SUCCESS SYSTEM**

## ‚úÖ **OLD APPROACH ‚Üí NEW APPROACH**

### **‚ùå What We're Removing:**
- Complex scenarios thrown at novices
- Blank text boxes with no guidance
- Mock/fallback data
- One-size-fits-all lessons
- Generic feedback
- Overwhelming frameworks

### **‚úÖ What We're Building:**
- **Granular micro-lessons** focused on single skills
- **Scaffolded progression** (multiple choice ‚Üí guided ‚Üí free-form)
- **100% AI-powered** with real-time generation
- **Rubric-based scoring** (1-10 scale, 7.5+ to pass)
- **Skill mastery tracking** in toolkit
- **Real-world context** with user's actual organization

## üß© **MICRO-LEARNING ARCHITECTURE**

### **Micro-Lesson Structure:**
Each lesson teaches **ONE specific skill** like:
- Writing email subject lines
- Crafting AI prompts for data analysis  
- Setting professional tone
- Structuring meeting agendas
- Creating automation workflows

### **Scaffolded Progression:**
1. **Multiple Choice** - Learn concepts with guided options
2. **Fill-in-the-Blank** - Practice with structured templates
3. **Guided Template** - Use frameworks with hints
4. **Free-form with Hints** - Independent practice with support

### **AI Integration:**
- User works **with AI** to solve problems
- Real-time AI generation (no mock data ever)
- User learns effective prompting techniques
- AI provides immediate, scored feedback

---

## üìä **SCORING & PROGRESSION SYSTEM**

### **Rubric Scoring (1-10 Scale):**
- **9-10:** Exceptional - Ready for advanced practice
- **7.5-8.9:** Proficient - Can proceed to next micro-lesson  
- **6-7.4:** Developing - Retry required with hints
- **Below 6:** Retry required with additional scaffolding

### **What Gets Measured:**
- **Quality assessments:** Tone, clarity, effectiveness
- **Deterministic outputs:** Length, structure, required elements
- **Prompt effectiveness:** How well their AI prompts work

### **Retry Logic:**
- Below 7.5 = Must retry before proceeding
- Each retry gets more scaffolding/hints
- Progress tracked so they see skill improvement

## üéØ **EXAMPLE MICRO-LESSON FLOW**

### **Lesson: "Email Subject Line Mastery" with Maya**

**Stage 1 - Multiple Choice:**
"Which subject line would be most effective for a donor update email?"
- A) "Important Update"
- B) "Your Impact: 500 Families Fed This Month" ‚úì
- C) "Newsletter #47"
- D) "Please Read"

**Stage 2 - Fill-in-the-Blank:**
"Complete this subject line template: 'Your [IMPACT] helped us [SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT] this [TIME PERIOD]'"

**Stage 3 - Guided Template:**
"Using the formula [Action] + [Benefit] + [Urgency], write a subject line for your board meeting agenda."

**Stage 4 - Free-form with AI:**
"Write 3 subject lines for different stakeholder types at your organization. Use AI to test which ones perform best."

**AI Scoring Each Stage:**
- Clarity: 8/10
- Action Orientation: 9/10  
- Professional Tone: 7/10
- Brevity: 8/10
- **Overall: 8/10 ‚Üí PASS, proceed to next micro-lesson**
