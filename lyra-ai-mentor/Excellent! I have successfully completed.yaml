Excellent! I have successfully completed the comprehensive implementation of the dynamic PACE system. Let me provide a summary of what was 
  accomplished.

  Summary of Dynamic PACE System Implementation

  I successfully completed the deployment of a comprehensive dynamic PACE system that transforms Maya's static choice model into a true 
  branching personalization engine. Here's what was accomplished:

  ✅ Core System Architecture

  - Dynamic Choice Engine: Built sophisticated P→A→C→E branching where each choice creates different user journeys
  - Content Adaptation Engine: Real-time adaptation based on user path combinations
  - System-wide Personalization: Infrastructure ready for expansion to all characters

  ✅ Technical Implementation

  - Missing Functions Added: Implemented getSmartRecommendations, getContextualTemplate, and getContentAdaptation in MayaEmailComposer.tsx
  - Type Safety: All components properly typed with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
  - Integration Complete: New dynamic functions integrated with existing PACE system while maintaining backward compatibility

  ✅ Personalization Components

  - PersonalizationWorkflow: Complete guided workflow with step management
  - ContentAdaptationEngine: Real-time content routing and adaptation
  - DynamicAudienceSelector: Purpose-specific audience descriptions with segmentation
  - PathAwareContentStrategy: Personalized recommendations based on choice paths
  - AdaptiveExecutionPanel: Dynamic templates with AI-powered personalization
  - PersonalizedExamples: Context-specific examples and case studies
  - ContentManagementSystem: Complete content management with analytics

  ✅ Testing & Verification

  - Function Testing: All dynamic functions tested and working correctly
  - Path Combinations: P→A→C→E branching tested with various combinations
  - Persistence Verification: Cross-session data persistence confirmed working
  - Build Validation: TypeScript compilation and build process successful

  ✅ Key Features Delivered

  1. True Dynamic Branching: Purpose choices filter available audiences, audience choices filter content strategies, creating unique user 
  journeys

  2. Intelligent Recommendations: AI-driven suggestions tailored to individual user paths and preferences
  3. Adaptive Template Mechanisms: Flexible content structures that dynamically reshape based on interaction patterns
  4. Seamless Session Continuity: Intelligent tracking of user preferences across multiple interactions
  5. Comprehensive Performance Metrics: Advanced analytics for continuous system refinement
  6. Scalable Architecture: Modular design enabling rapid expansion across Lyra's character ecosystem

  I've created a transformative personalization framework that delivers deeply customized experiences through intelligent, adaptive 
  interactions.

⏺ Dynamic PACE System Implementation Complete ✅

  I've successfully deployed the comprehensive dynamic PACE system for Maya, transforming the static choice model into a true branching
  personalization engine.

  Key Accomplishments:

  🎯 Core Dynamic Functions Implemented:
  - getSmartRecommendations() - AI-powered suggestions based on P+A combinations
  - getContextualTemplate() - Dynamic template structures for each path
  - getContentAdaptation() - Sophisticated tone filtering and reasoning

  🔄 True Branching System:
  - Purpose choices filter available audiences
  - Audience choices filter content strategies
  - Each P→A→C→E path creates unique user journeys
  - Content, examples, and templates adapt dynamically

  💾 Personalization Infrastructure:
  - Cross-session persistence with localStorage
  - Pattern learning and recommendation scoring
  - Performance tracking and analytics
  - System-wide foundation ready for all characters

  ✅ Testing Verified:
  - All P→A→C→E path combinations working
  - Dynamic functions returning correct adaptations
  - Personalization persisting across sessions
  - TypeScript compilation and build successful

  The system now delivers personalized user journeys where choice paths matter, creating different content experiences, customized examples,
  and adapted execution strategies - exactly as requested. This foundation supports expansion to make the entire Lyra platform dynamically
  personalized.
