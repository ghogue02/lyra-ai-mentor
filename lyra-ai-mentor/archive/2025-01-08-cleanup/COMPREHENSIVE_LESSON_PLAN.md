## 🏗️ **Architecture Foundation**

### **Core UX Pattern (Based on Maya's Success)**
All lessons will implement the **LyraNarratedSideBySide** pattern:
- **Left Panel**: Character storytelling with Lyra narration
- **Right Panel**: Interactive workspace with blur-to-clarity effects  
- **PACE Framework**: Purpose → Audience → Connection → Execute
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Layer-by-layer skill building
- **Fast-Forward Testing**: Developer-friendly testing controls
- **Multi-Level Content**: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced adaptations

### **Visual Consistency Standards**
```typescript
// Character Color Schemes
const characterColors = {
  maya: { primary: 'purple', secondary: 'pink' },      // Communication
  sofia: { primary: 'orange', secondary: 'amber' },   // Storytelling  
  david: { primary: 'blue', secondary: 'cyan' },      // Data & Analytics
  rachel: { primary: 'green', secondary: 'emerald' }, // Automation
  alex: { primary: 'red', secondary: 'rose' }         // Strategy & Leadership
};
```

## 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

### **TDD (Test-Driven Development) Approach**

#### **Component-Level Testing**
```typescript
// Example: Sofia Voice Discovery Tests
describe('SofiaVoiceDiscoveryLesson', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    render(<SofiaVoiceDiscoveryLesson />);
  });

  describe('VOICE Framework Integration', () => {
    it('should guide through Values → Origin → Impact → Craft → Expression');
    it('should show progressive completion in voice summary panel');
    it('should record and analyze voice samples');
    it('should provide authenticity feedback');
  });

  describe('Blur Effect Implementation', () => {
    it('should start with muffled blur representing voice uncertainty');
    it('should clear as user discovers authentic voice');
    it('should sync blur clearing with narrative progression');
  });

  describe('Fast-Forward Functionality', () => {
    it('should complete all voice discovery steps instantly');
    it('should show final voice profile immediately');
    it('should enable rapid testing of complete workflow');
  });
});
```

#### **Integration Testing**
```typescript
describe('Chapter 3 Integration Tests', () => {
  it('should allow users to progress from Maya → Sofia → Integration lessons');
  it('should carry communication insights across lessons');
  it('should provide cross-lesson progress tracking');
  it('should enable export of complete communication toolkit');
});
```

### **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) Scenarios**

#### **User Journey Testing**
```typescript
describe('Communication Mastery Journey - BDD', () => {
  scenario('Complete communication transformation', () => {
    given('I struggle with clear communication');
    when('I complete Maya\'s PACE framework training');
    and('I develop my authentic voice with Sofia');
    and('I integrate both approaches in lesson 13');
    then('I can communicate effectively across all channels');
    and('I have measurable improvement in engagement metrics');
    and('I feel confident in any communication scenario');
  });

  scenario('Data-driven decision making mastery', () => {
    given('I am overwhelmed by data and unclear insights');
    when('I learn David\'s DATA framework');
    and('I practice with real organizational datasets');
    and('I create compelling data visualizations');
    then('I can extract meaningful insights from any dataset');
    and('I can present data stories that drive decisions');
    and('I have built automated analytics workflows');
  });
});
```

### **AI Integration Testing**
```typescript
describe('AI Service Integration', () => {
  it('should handle AI service failures gracefully');
  it('should provide meaningful fallback responses');
  it('should track AI usage and optimization');
  it('should enable offline lesson completion');
