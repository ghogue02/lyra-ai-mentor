# Dynamic PACE Integration Test Checklist

## ‚úÖ Build & Compilation
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] All imports properly resolved

## üîç Component Integration Tests

### 1. Route Loading
- [ ] `/lyra-maya-demo` route loads without errors
- [ ] Component renders correctly
- [ ] No console errors on initial load

### 2. Dynamic PACE Initialization
- [ ] `createUserContext()` function creates valid user context
- [ ] User context includes all required fields:
  - [ ] userId
  - [ ] currentSkillLevel
  - [ ] timeAvailable
  - [ ] stressLevel
  - [ ] confidenceLevel
  - [ ] preferredCommunicationStyle
  - [ ] pastPerformance
  - [ ] currentGoals
  - [ ] activeConstraints
  - [ ] learningPreferences

### 3. Dynamic Path Generation
- [ ] `generateDynamicPath()` is called when purpose is selected
- [ ] Loading state (`isLoadingDynamic`) properly managed
- [ ] Dynamic path is generated successfully
- [ ] Error handling works if generation fails
- [ ] Maya journey state is updated with dynamic values:
  - [ ] purpose
  - [ ] audience
  - [ ] audienceContext
  - [ ] tone

### 4. Stage Creation with Dynamic Context
- [ ] `createDynamicMayaStages()` receives all required parameters:
  - [ ] panelBlurLevel function
  - [ ] mayaJourney state
  - [ ] setMayaJourney setter
  - [ ] setCurrentStageIndex
  - [ ] setLyraExpression
  - [ ] user object
  - [ ] setIsGeneratingAI
  - [ ] aiResults
  - [ ] setAIResults
  - [ ] generateDynamicPath function
  - [ ] dynamicPath state
  - [ ] isLoadingDynamic state
  - [ ] userProfile
  - [ ] userContext (from createUserContext())

### 5. Dynamic Choice Service Integration
- [ ] `dynamicChoiceService.generateDynamicPath()` is called correctly
- [ ] Purpose types are properly typed
- [ ] Constraints are passed correctly:
  - [ ] maxTime: 20
  - [ ] difficultyLevel: 'medium'
  - [ ] requiredFeatures: ['nonprofit_examples', 'maya_narrative']

### 6. User Personalization
- [ ] User profile is properly constructed
- [ ] Personalization preferences are applied
- [ ] Context-aware choices are generated

### 7. State Management
- [ ] `dynamicPath` state updates correctly
- [ ] `availablePaths` array is managed properly
- [ ] Loading states transition smoothly
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully

### 8. UI/UX Flow
- [ ] Dynamic choices appear at appropriate stage
- [ ] Loading indicators show during generation
- [ ] Transitions between stages work smoothly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained

### 9. Memory and Persistence
- [ ] User selections are remembered
- [ ] Path choices persist through stage transitions
- [ ] Narrative adapts based on dynamic choices

### 10. Performance
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Component unmounts cleanly
- [ ] Async operations properly cancelled on unmount
- [ ] Render performance acceptable

## üìù Manual Testing Steps

1. **Initial Load Test**
   - Navigate to `/lyra-maya-demo`
   - Verify no console errors
   - Check that Lyra avatar appears

2. **Purpose Selection Test**
   - Progress to purpose selection stage
   - Select a purpose
   - Verify loading state appears
   - Confirm dynamic path is generated

3. **Dynamic Content Test**
   - Check that audience options reflect dynamic generation
   - Verify tone suggestions are personalized
   - Confirm content adapts to user context

4. **Complete Flow Test**
   - Complete entire Maya journey
   - Verify all dynamic elements work
   - Check final email reflects dynamic choices

5. **Error Handling Test**
   - Test with network disconnection
   - Verify graceful fallback behavior
   - Check error messages are user-friendly

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

1. **Async State Updates**
   - Ensure setState calls don't cause race conditions
   - Verify cleanup on component unmount

2. **Type Safety**
   - All dynamic choice types properly typed
   - No any types in critical paths

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Dynamic choices display correctly on mobile
   - Touch interactions work smoothly

## üöÄ Performance Benchmarks

- Initial load time: < 2s
- Dynamic path generation: < 1s
- Stage transitions: < 300ms
- Memory usage: < 50MB increase

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

- [ ] All checklist items pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Smooth user experience
- [ ] Dynamic choices feel natural and helpful
- [ ] Performance metrics met
