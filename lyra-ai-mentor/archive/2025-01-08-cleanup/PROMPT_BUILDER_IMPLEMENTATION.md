  - Educational tooltips explaining each section's importance
  - Maya's tips for effective prompting
  - Smooth animations and transitions

### 2. Integration
- **Modified**: `LyraNarratedMayaDynamicComplete.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported PromptBuilder component
  - Added PromptBuilder after stage content
  - Shows after Stage 1 (Welcome) to start building understanding
  - Positioned at bottom of interactive panel
  - Responsive to current stage progress

### 3. Key Features

#### Dynamic Prompt Sections:
1. **Purpose**: Translates selected purpose into natural language
2. **Audience**: Shows audience selection with key characteristics
3. **Motivations**: Displays what matters to the audience

## How It Works

1. **Stage 1 (Welcome)**: Prompt builder appears but is empty
2. **Stage 2 (Purpose)**: First section populates with purpose selection
3. **Stage 3 (Audience)**: Audience sections appear with motivations
4. **Stage 4 (Content)**: Framework section shows selected approach
5. **Stage 5+ (Tone/Execute)**: Additional sections populate

The prompt builder shows users:
- How each PACE choice contributes to the final prompt
- The structure of effective AI prompts
- The importance of specificity in each section
- How to create prompts that generate personalized, effective emails

## Benefits

1. **Educational**: Users learn prompt engineering through practice
2. **Transparent**: Shows exactly how PACE creates AI prompts
3. **Practical**: Users can copy prompts for their own use
4. **Engaging**: Interactive and visually appealing
5. **Progressive**: Builds understanding step-by-step

## Testing Recommendations

1. Navigate to `/lyra-maya-demo`
2. Progress through each PACE stage
3. Watch the prompt builder populate
4. Test copy functionality
5. Try different purpose/audience combinations
6. Verify tooltips and help text
7. Test expand/collapse functionality
