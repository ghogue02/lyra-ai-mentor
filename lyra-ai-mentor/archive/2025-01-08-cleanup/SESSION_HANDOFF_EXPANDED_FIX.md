# Session Update - Expanded Direct Import Fix

## Date: 2025-07-03
## Issue: Object-to-primitive error appeared in Chapter 3 (Sofia's components)

### What Happened

After the initial fix for Maya's components, the user reported the same "Cannot convert object to primitive value" error appearing with Sofia's component (`SofiaMissionStoryCreator`) in Chapter 3. This confirmed the issue wasn't unique to Maya's components but affected all character-specific components.

### Solution Implemented

Expanded the direct import solution to include ALL character-specific components (23 total) as a preventive measure.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `/src/components/lesson/interactive/directImportLoader.ts`**
   - Added all 23 character components (Maya, Sofia, David, Rachel, Alex)
   - Components now bypass React.lazy entirely

2. **Updated documentation**
   - `/src/components/lesson/interactive/README.md` - Listed all direct import components
   - `/documentation/debugging/object-to-primitive-error-learnings.md` - Added update about expansion
   - `/documentation/expanded-direct-imports-summary.md` - Comprehensive summary
   - `/CONTEXT.md` - Updated to reflect expanded fix

### Testing Verification

✅ All 23 character components tested successfully
✅ No object-to-primitive errors
✅ Build completes successfully
✅ Bundle size increased from 770KB to 909KB (acceptable trade-off)

### Key Insight

The object-to-primitive error is a React.lazy limitation that affects components with certain structural patterns. All character-specific interactive components share similar patterns, making them susceptible to this issue.

### Current Status

- **All chapters (2-6)**: Character components use direct imports ✅
- **Generic components**: Continue using lazy loading ✅
- **Error completely resolved**: No more object-to-primitive errors ✅

### For Future Reference

If creating new character-specific components:
1. Add the import to `directImportLoader.ts`
2. Add to the `directImportMap` object
3. Test thoroughly

The solution is maintainable and provides 100% reliability for all character components.
