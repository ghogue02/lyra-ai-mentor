## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
- **File**: `/src/components/interactive/MayaEmailComposer.tsx`
- **Lines Added**: ~150+ lines of new functionality
- **Dependencies**: Uses existing `dynamicChoiceService` and types

### Key Functions Added

1. **`createMayaUserContext()`**
   - Creates realistic user context for Maya (nonprofit director)
   - Sets stress level, confidence, time constraints, and goals

2. **`mapToDynamicPurpose()`**  
   - Maps static purpose IDs to dynamic choice engine types
   - Ensures seamless integration between systems

3. **`generateDynamicAudiences()`**
   - Main AI integration function
   - Calls dynamic choice service to generate personalized paths
   - Enhances static options with AI insights

4. **`generatePersonalizedContent()`**
   - Creates content suggestions based on chosen dynamic path
   - Provides personalized opening, structure, and closing strategies

### State Management Added
```typescript
// Dynamic Choice Service State
const [currentChoicePath, setCurrentChoicePath] = useState<ChoicePath | null>(null);
const [dynamicAudiences, setDynamicAudiences] = useState<any[]>([]);
const [isGeneratingDynamicChoices, setIsGeneratingDynamicChoices] = useState(false);
const [dynamicError, setDynamicError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

## Integration Strategy

### Purpose Selection Flow
1. User selects a purpose ‚Üí triggers `handlePurposeSelect()`
2. System calls `generateDynamicAudiences()` with purpose
3. AI generates choice path and enhances static audience options
4. UI shows enhanced options with AI badges and insights

### Audience Selection Flow  
1. User selects enhanced audience ‚Üí triggers `handleAudienceSelect()`
2. System calls `generatePersonalizedContent()` 
3. AI creates personalized content strategy
4. Content step shows AI-enhanced tone and structure options

### Backward Compatibility
- Static filtering remains as fallback
- All existing functionality preserved
- Error handling ensures smooth degradation
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Visual Enhancements

### AI Enhancement Indicators
- **Purple badges** with sparkle icons on AI-enhanced options
- **Loading spinners** during AI processing  
- **Success/error toasts** for user feedback
- **AI insight cards** showing contextual reasoning

### User Feedback Messages
- "ü§ñ AI enhanced your audience options!"
- "üéØ AI generated personalized content strategy!"  
- "‚ö†Ô∏è AI enhancement unavailable, using Maya's experience instead"
