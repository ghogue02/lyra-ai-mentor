## Overview
This directory contains the refactored Maya Communication Mastery component, broken down from a single 2000+ line file into maintainable modules under 500 lines each.

## File Structure

### Core Files (All < 500 lines)
- **`types.ts`** (64 lines) - All TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

## Architecture

```
maya/
├── types.ts              # TypeScript definitions
├── helpers.ts            # Utility functions
├── hooks.ts              # Custom React hooks
├── MayaJourneyPanel.tsx  # Summary component
├── stages.tsx            # Stage definitions
└── LyraNarratedMayaSideBySideComplete.tsx  # Main component
```

## Usage

The component maintains the same API and functionality as before:

```typescript
import LyraNarratedMayaSideBySideComplete from './LyraNarratedMayaSideBySideComplete';

// Usage remains exactly the same
<LyraNarratedMayaSideBySideComplete />
```

## Three-Column Layout Features

- **Column 1 (25%)**: Summary Panel - Always visible on desktop
- **Column 2 (37.5%)**: Lyra Chat - Storytelling and narrative
- **Column 3 (37.5%)**: Interactive Content - Maya's lesson components
- **Mobile**: Responsive stack layout with overlay panel

## Future Enhancements

This modular structure makes it easy to:
- Add new stages in `stages.tsx`
- Extend functionality with new hooks in `hooks.ts`
- Add utility functions in `helpers.ts`
- Enhance the journey panel in `MayaJourneyPanel.tsx`
- Modify types in `types.ts`
