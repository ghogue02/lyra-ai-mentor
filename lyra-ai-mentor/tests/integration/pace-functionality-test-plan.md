}
```

## Test Execution Plan

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Purpose Selection Flow**
   ```
   1. Load MayaEmailComposer
   2. Verify all purpose cards visible
   3. Click "Professional Update"
   4. Verify selection highlights
   5. Check progress bar shows 25%
   6. Verify audience section unlocks
   ```

2. **Audience Selection Flow**
   ```
   1. With purpose selected
   2. Verify filtered audiences show
   3. Select "Colleague"
   4. Verify selection highlights
   5. Check progress bar shows 50%
   6. Verify content section unlocks
   ```

3. **Content Strategy Flow**
   ```
   1. With purpose and audience selected
   2. Verify filtered content strategies
   3. Select "Informative"
   4. Verify selection highlights
   5. Check progress bar shows 75%
   6. Verify execution section unlocks
   ```

4. **Execution Flow**
   ```
   1. With all prior selections
   2. Verify template generates
   3. Check personalized guidance
   4. Verify progress shows 100%
   5. Test email generation
   ```

### Automated Test Cases

```typescript
describe('PACE Functionality', () => {
  test('Purpose selection triggers audience filtering', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('Audience selection triggers content adaptation', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('Complete PACE flow generates correct template', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  test('Error handling for invalid sequences', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Success Criteria
