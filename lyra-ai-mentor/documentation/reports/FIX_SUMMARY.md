# 🚨 VISIBILITY FIX - ACTION REQUIRED

## Problem
You're only seeing 2 elements per chapter instead of 6-11.

## Root Causes Found
1. No database column issues (is_active/is_gated don't exist in code)
2. All 177 elements are in the database correctly
3. The issue is likely browser-side (caching or rendering)

## 🎯 Immediate Fix

### 1. Run This SQL
```bash
RUN_THIS_TO_FIX_VISIBILITY.sql
```

### 2. Clear Browser Completely
- Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Clear site data: DevTools → Application → Clear Storage → Clear site data

### 3. Check Debug Panel
I've added a debug panel to lesson pages (bottom-right corner) that shows:
- Database count vs rendered count
- Lists all elements that should be visible
- Highlights any mismatches

## 📊 What You Should See

### Example: Chapter 2, Lesson 5 (11 elements total)
1. Maya Rodriguez is facing a challenge... (lyra_chat)
2. Automating Nonprofit Communications (content block)
3. Help Maya Write the Parent Response (ai_email_composer)
4. Maya's Board Chair Challenge (difficult_conversation_helper)
5. Maya's Coffee Chat: What's Next? (lyra_chat)
6. Help James Complete His Grant Proposal (document_generator)
7. Quick Access: Automated Element Enhancer
8. And more...

## 🔍 Debug Panel Shows

```
🐛 Element Visibility Debug
Database Says:
- Content Blocks: 0
- Interactive Elements: 11
- Total Expected: 11

DOM Shows:
- Rendered Content Blocks: 0
- Rendered Interactive: 2
- Total Divs in Lesson: 2

⚠️ Mismatch Detected!
Missing: 9 elements
```

## ✅ When Fixed

The debug panel should show matching numbers:
```
Database Says: 11
DOM Shows: 11
```

## 🛠️ If Still Broken

1. **Check Console**: Press F12 → Console tab → Look for red errors
2. **Try Incognito Mode**: Rules out extension conflicts
3. **Check Network Tab**: Ensure Supabase requests succeed

## 📝 Notes

- "Board Defense Strategy" is real - it's Rachel's element in Chapter 5
- Content blocking is disabled in LessonContent.tsx (always returns false)
- All elements have AI configuration and proper content

**The data is perfect. This is a rendering issue. Run the SQL, clear cache, and check the debug panel!**
