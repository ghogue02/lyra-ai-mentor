## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Interactive Component
**Issue:** Content block at order_index 50 is marked as `interactive_element_placeholder`

**Impact:** Minor - variance expected based on user engagement  
**Recommendation:** Monitor actual user completion times

- ✓ Asset configuration present (lines 82-87, 112-117)
- ✓ Completion callbacks implemented
- ✓ Special rendering with avatar and icons

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Replace placeholder** at order_index 50 with actual component or remove

### Medium Priority
1. **Monitor completion times** to validate 20-minute estimate
2. **Consider adding email template saving** functionality

### Low Priority
1. **Add more board/executive scenarios** to email composer
2. **Include email threading examples** for follow-ups

## Test Conclusion

Chapter 2 Lesson 1 successfully teaches AI-powered email writing with functional, well-integrated components. The lesson provides comprehensive practice opportunities for both standard and difficult email scenarios. Minor issues identified do not impact core learning objectives.
