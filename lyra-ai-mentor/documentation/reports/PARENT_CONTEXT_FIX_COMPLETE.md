# Parent Context Fix Complete

## Problem Identified
The first interactive element "Help Maya Write the Parent Response" appeared without any story context or setup, leaving users confused about:
- Who is requesting a response
- What the concern is about
- Why Maya needs to write this email

## Solution Implemented
Added a new content block at order index 45: **"Maya's First Test: The Concerned Parent Email"**

This content block:
1. Introduces Sarah Chen as a concerned parent
2. Explains her specific worry (new 5:30 PM pickup time conflicts with her 6 PM work schedule)
3. Shows why this email is challenging for Maya
4. Creates a natural transition to the interactive element

## Updated Lesson Flow
1. **Enter the AI Email Revolution** (order 40) - Introduces AI tools
2. **Maya's First Test: The Concerned Parent Email** (order 45) - NEW! Sets up the scenario
3. **Help Maya Write the Parent Response** (order 50) - Interactive element now has context

## Interactive Element Updates
- Added description explaining Sarah Chen's concern
- Included detailed prompt with all necessary context
- Users now understand exactly what they're helping Maya accomplish

## Technical Implementation
- Created Edge Function `add-parent-context` to bypass RLS policies
- Successfully inserted content block with proper order index
- Updated interactive element with contextual information
- All changes applied automatically without manual SQL

The lesson now flows naturally, and users have full context before encountering the interactive element!
