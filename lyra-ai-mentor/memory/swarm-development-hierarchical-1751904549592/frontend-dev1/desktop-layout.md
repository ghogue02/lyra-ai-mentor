# Desktop Three-Column Layout Implementation for LyraNarratedMayaSideBySideComplete

## Overview
Implemented a desktop three-column layout using CSS Grid with precise column widths:
- Left Column (Summary Panel): 25%
- Middle Column (Lyra's Narrative): 37.5%
- Right Column (Interactive Panel): 37.5%

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Updates (LyraNarratedMayaSideBySideComplete.tsx)

#### Grid Container Configuration
```tsx
// Three-Column Layout - CSS Grid Container
<div className={cn(
  "h-screen overflow-hidden",
  isMobile ? "flex flex-col" : "grid",
  !isMobile && showSummaryPanel && "grid-cols-[25%_37.5%_37.5%] gap-0",
  !isMobile && !showSummaryPanel && "grid-cols-2 gap-0"
)}>
```

#### Layout Structure
- **Summary Panel (Left - 25%)**: Contains journey progress and skill tracking
- **Main Content Area (Spans 2 columns)**: Contains both narrative and interactive panels
  - **Narrative Panel (Middle - 37.5%)**: Lyra's storytelling section
  - **Interactive Panel (Right - 37.5%)**: User interaction components

### 2. CSS Styling (maya-journey-layout.css)

#### Desktop Grid Layout
```css
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .maya-three-column-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 25% 37.5% 37.5%;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
  }
}
```

#### Key Features
- **No overlapping**: Each panel has defined boundaries with 2px borders
- **Proper spacing**: No gaps between columns, clean borders for separation
- **Responsive design**: Maintains layout stability across viewport sizes
- **Performance optimized**: GPU acceleration for smooth transitions

### 3. Component Structure Changes

#### Before (Two-Column)
```
Container
├── Summary Panel (320px fixed)
└── Main Content (1fr)
    ├── Narrative (50%)
    └── Interactive (50%)
```

#### After (Three-Column)
```
Container (grid-cols-[25%_37.5%_37.5%])
├── Summary Panel (25%)
├── Narrative Panel (37.5%)
└── Interactive Panel (37.5%)
```

### 4. Border and Spacing Configuration
- Summary Panel: `border-right: 2px solid #e5e7eb`
- Narrative Panel: `border-right: 2px solid #e5e7eb`
- No gaps between columns (`gap-0`)
- Clean visual separation without overlap

### 5. Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop (≥1024px)**: Three-column grid layout
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: Summary panel as slide-out overlay
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Stacked vertical layout

### 6. Accessibility Features
- Proper focus states with purple outline
- High contrast mode support
- Keyboard navigation friendly
- ARIA labels maintained

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- CSS containment for layout stability
- GPU acceleration for animations
- Optimized scrolling with custom scrollbars
- Smooth transitions (300ms ease-in-out)
