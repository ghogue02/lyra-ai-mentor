REACT_APP_SWARM_TOPOLOGY=hierarchical
```

### 2. **API Key Source**
- **OpenAI:** https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 3. **Start the System**
```bash
npm start
# System automatically detects and configures available APIs
```

2. Fill in:
   - **Demo Name:** e.g., "Sofia Voice Discovery Workshop"
   - **Character:** Choose from Maya, Sofia, David, Rachel, Alex
   - **Concept:** Describe your lesson idea
   - **Learning Objectives:** Add specific goals

3. Click **"Create Demo with Swarm"**
   - System initializes swarm coordination
   - Live AI agents are assigned based on your concept

### **Step 2: Test Live AI Interactions**
1. Switch to **"Interactions"** tab
2. Choose interaction type:
   - **Email Composer** - Live AI writes professional emails
   - **Data Analyzer** - Live AI analyzes and interprets data
   - **Automation Builder** - Live AI creates workflow automations
   - **Voice Interface** - Live AI handles speech/audio scenarios
   - **Conversation Handler** - Live AI manages difficult conversations

3. Enter your test prompt
4. **Watch live AI generate responses** using your character's rules

### **Step 3: Approve for Production**
1. Test multiple interactions to validate concept
2. Move to **"Prototype"** phase for advanced testing
3. **Approve for Production** to generate actual lesson components

## 🧠 **ULTRA-DEEP SWARM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Coordinated AI Systems**
Your system now operates with multiple coordinated AI agents:

```
🏗️ HIERARCHICAL COORDINATION
├── 🎯 Orchestrator Agent (Master coordinator)
├── 📝 Content Generator (Stories, scenarios, examples)  
├── ⚡ Code Generator (React components, TypeScript)
├── 🔗 AI Integrator (Live API connections)
├── 🧪 Quality Assurance (Testing, validation)
├── 🚀 Production Manager (Git workflows, deployment)
└── 💾 Memory Manager (Persistent state, learning)
```

### **Live AI Coordination Flow**
1. **User Input** → Swarm receives lesson concept
2. **Task Orchestration** → MCP tools coordinate specialized agents
3. **Live AI Execution** → Real API calls to OpenAI/Claude
4. **Character Rules Application** → Responses follow your rules engine
5. **Quality Validation** → Automatic compliance checking
6. **Result Synthesis** → Coordinated final output

---

## 🔥 **KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### ✅ **Live AI Integration**
- **Real API calls** to OpenAI GPT-4o model
- **Character-specific prompts** using your rules engine configuration
- **Automatic fallback** to enhanced responses if API fails
- **Swarm-coordinated execution** through MCP tools

### ✅ **MCP Swarm Orchestration**
- **Batch operations** for parallel agent spawning (following CLAUDE.md)
- **Real-time task coordination** across specialized agents
- **Memory persistence** across sessions
- **Neural pattern learning** from successful interactions
- **Fault tolerance** with graceful degradation

### ✅ **Character Rules Engine Integration**
- **Personality-driven responses** for each character (Maya, Sofia, David, Rachel, Alex)
- **Context-aware prompting** based on interaction type
- **Nonprofit-focused scenarios** and examples
- **Consistent voice and tone** across all generated content

### ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **API failure resilience** with multiple fallback strategies
- **Graceful degradation** to enhanced template responses
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and optimization
- **User-friendly error messages** with clear next steps

---

## 🎛️ **RULES ENGINE ACCESS**

**Your rules are already configured** from the previous session:
- **Character personalities** and communication styles
- **Content generation preferences** and narrative approaches
- **Visual design consistency** levels
- **User interaction complexity** settings
- **Motivation and gamification** strategies

**To modify rules:** `http://localhost:8080/admin/rules-engine`

## 📊 **PERFORMANCE MONITORING**

The system includes real-time monitoring:

```javascript
// Check swarm status in browser console
console.log('Live AI Status:', {
  OpenAI: 'Available (gpt-4o)',
  Endpoint: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
  SwarmAgents: 12,
  ActiveTasks: 3,
  MemoryPersistence: 'enabled'
});
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **No Live AI Responses?**
1. Check `.env` file has API keys configured
2. Verify API keys are valid (check console for error messages)
3. Ensure at least one API key is working (OpenAI or Claude)
4. Check browser console for detailed error logs

### **Swarm Coordination Issues?**
1. MCP tools fall back gracefully to direct operation
2. Check browser console for swarm status logs
3. System continues working even without MCP coordination

### **Character Rules Not Applied?**
1. Ensure rules engine configuration is complete
2. Check `http://localhost:5173/admin/rules-engine` for missing answers
3. Rules are automatically loaded into live AI prompts
