# Claude Session Log - 2025-07-03 17:20:00

## Session Start
- Time: 17:20:00 PST
- Context: Verifying Chapter 2 character assignments - potential misunderstanding
- User: Greg Hogue
- Critical Issue: May have incorrect understanding of lesson-character mapping

## Initial Actions
1. Read CONTEXT.md
2. Review Chapter 2 lesson structure
3. Identify source of confusion
4. Prepare clarifying questions

## Investigation Results

### Chapter 2 Lesson Structure (from database):
- **Lesson 5**: Maya Rodriguez (Email transformation) ✅
- **Lesson 6**: James Chen (Document creation) ✅
- **Lesson 7**: Generic content (but configs show Maya)
- **Lesson 8**: Generic content (but configs show James)

### The Confusion Point:
In Lesson 6 (James's story), the database shows:
- Element type: `document_generator`
- Title: "Maya's Grant Proposal Challenge" ❌
- This IS a mismatch - James's lesson using Maya-named component

### InteractiveElementRenderer Check:
Need to verify what component is actually rendered for Lesson 6

## MCP Guidelines Created

### Files Created:
1. `/documentation/guides/mcp-database-connection-guide.md`
   - Connection protocol for MCP server
   - Database verification queries
   - Content sync workflow
   - Common pitfalls to avoid

2. `/tests/database-content-sync.test.ts`
   - Deterministic test suite for content verification
   - Character consistency checks
   - Component alignment verification
   - Content variety analysis

### CONTEXT.md Updates:
- Added MCP Database Connection guide to guidelines
- Updated mandatory tests to include database sync check
- Modified active tasks to prioritize database verification

## Key Insight
The user showed me that Lesson 6 is actually Maya's story about document creation, not James's. This highlights the critical importance of:
1. Always checking live database content
2. Not trusting potentially outdated SQL files
3. Running sync tests before making assumptions

## User Clarifications Received

### Chapter Structure Confirmed:
- Each chapter = Single character journey
- Chapter 1: Introduction (no specific character)
- Chapter 2: Maya's complete journey (all 4 lessons)
- Chapters 3-6: Different characters each

### Action Items:
1. Remove ALL James references from Chapter 2
2. Ensure all Chapter 2 components are Maya-prefixed
3. Archive SQL migration files
4. Set up automatic sync tests
5. Creative freedom to suggest storyline improvements

### SECURITY CONCERN:
User provided database password in plain text. Need to recommend secure connection method.

## Actions Completed

### Security & Guidelines
1. Created `.env.local.example` for secure password storage
2. Updated CONTEXT.md with database security guidelines
3. Created Storyline Evolution Guidelines with approval process

### Archival
1. Archived all SQL migration files to `/archive/2025-07-03/sql-migrations/`
2. Created manifest explaining outdated content (James in Chapter 2)
3. Added README pointing to current database as source of truth

### Prepared for Database Work
1. Created `/scripts/remove-james-references.ts` with action plan
2. Defined Maya document metrics for time savings
3. Listed Maya components needed for document creation

## Awaiting Database Connection

### Connection Options:
1. **MCP Tools**: If configured in Claude Desktop, use `mcp__supabase_query`
2. **Supabase CLI**: If installed locally
3. **Direct Connection**: Requires secure password handling

### Once Connected, Will:
1. Verify Chapter 2 is entirely Maya's journey
2. Remove any James references from database
3. Update all interactive elements with time metrics
4. Create missing Maya document components
5. Run content sync test to verify changes
