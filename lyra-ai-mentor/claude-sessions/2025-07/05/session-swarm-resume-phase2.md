## Status: Resuming from Phase 1 completion, implementing critical fixes

### 🐝 Swarm Status
- **Active Swarms**: 3 swarms with specialized agents
- **Total Agents**: 13 specialized agents coordinating
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Critical fixes before magical enhancements
- **Memory Storage**: Restored cross-agent coordination data

### 🎯 Session Objectives
1. **Resume Coordination**: Successfully restored swarm state from Phase 1
2. **Critical Fixes**: Address character consistency, bundle size, ESLint issues
3. **Magical Enhancements**: Implement character-specific magical features
4. **Performance**: Maintain optimization focus throughout

### ✅ Immediate Actions Completed
- ✅ Swarm re-initialized with hierarchical topology
- ✅ 13 specialized agents spawned and coordinated
- ✅ Phase 2 coordination context stored in memory
- ✅ Session logging established

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Execute character consistency fixes (13 content blocks)
2. Implement bundle optimization strategies
3. Resolve ESLint issues systematically
4. Begin magical enhancement implementation

### 📊 Current Priorities
1. **🔴 HIGH**: Character consistency (Sofia contamination fix)
2. **🔴 HIGH**: Bundle size optimization (1,577KB → <500KB)
3. **🟡 MEDIUM**: ESLint resolution (312 issues)
4. **🟡 MEDIUM**: Magical feature implementation
