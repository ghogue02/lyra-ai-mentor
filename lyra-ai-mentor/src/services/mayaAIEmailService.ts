Hi Sarah!

I had to share this with you - after you helped with the art station yesterday, three different kids asked when "the nice art lady" was coming back!

Your patience with little Emma while she worked on her clay sculpture was exactly what she needed. She's been talking about it all week and even asked her mom to buy clay for home.

Thank you for bringing such joy and creativity to our Hope Gardens family. You're amazing!

With so much gratitude,
Maya`,
