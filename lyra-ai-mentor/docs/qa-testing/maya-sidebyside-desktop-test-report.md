# QA Test Report: MayaSideBySideFixed Desktop Viewport Testing

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive testing approach for verifying CSS fixes to resolve overlap issues in the MayaSideBySideFixed component across desktop viewports.

**Test Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Component:** MayaSideBySideFixed  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** Test Suite Created - Awaiting Execution

## Testing Approach

### 1. Viewport Sizes Tested
- **Desktop Small:** 1024px × 768px
- **Desktop Medium:** 1280px × 800px  
- **Desktop Large:** 1440px × 900px
- **Desktop Extra Large:** 1920px × 1080px
- **Tablet (Regression):** 768px × 1024px, 820px × 1180px

### 2. Key Testing Areas

#### A. Layout Integrity
- ✓ 50/50 panel split maintained
- ✓ Flex container with overflow hidden
- ✓ Max-width constraints respected
- ✓ Proper centering on large screens

#### B. Overlap Detection
- ✓ No overlapping between chat and interactive panels
- ✓ Proper spacing/gap between panels
- ✓ Border rendering between panels
- ✓ Z-index stacking context

#### C. Content Handling
- ✓ Scroll behavior in both panels
- ✓ Long content text wrapping
- ✓ Dynamic content updates
- ✓ Stage transition smoothness

#### D. Responsive Behavior
- ✓ Viewport resize handling
- ✓ Breakpoint transitions
- ✓ Mobile/tablet regression prevention

## Test Results Summary

### Critical Issues to Verify

1. **Panel Overlap**
   - Test: `checkForOverlaps()` helper verifies no overlap using getBoundingClientRect
   - Expected: `chatRect.right <= interactiveRect.left`
   - Risk: High - Core functionality issue

2. **Fixed Positioning**
   - Test: Check if summary panel uses fixed positioning
   - Expected: Chat panel remains visible during scrolling
   - Risk: Medium - UX degradation

3. **Z-Index Conflicts**
   - Test: Verify proper stacking order
   - Expected: No elements appear above/below incorrectly
   - Risk: Medium - Visual glitches

### Test Implementation Details

```typescript
// Core overlap detection logic
const checkForOverlaps = (container: HTMLElement) => {
  const chatPanel = screen.getByText("Maya's Guidance").closest('.w-1\\/2');
  const interactivePanel = container.querySelector('.w-1\\/2.flex.flex-col.bg-gradient-to-br');
  
  const chatRect = chatPanel.getBoundingClientRect();
  const interactiveRect = interactivePanel.getBoundingClientRect();
  
  return {
    hasOverlap: chatRect.right > interactiveRect.left,
    gap: interactiveRect.left - chatRect.right,
  };
};
```

## Test Execution Checklist

### Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Clear browser cache
- [ ] Disable browser extensions
- [ ] Use consistent DPI settings
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

### Manual Verification Steps

1. **Initial Load (All Viewports)**
   - [ ] Both panels visible
   - [ ] No content overlap
   - [ ] Proper alignment

2. **Interaction Flow**
   - [ ] Click "Let's Begin"
   - [ ] Select purpose option
   - [ ] Enter audience text
   - [ ] Select tone
   - [ ] Generate email
   - [ ] Verify layout integrity at each step

3. **Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Very long email addresses
   - [ ] Multiple rapid clicks
   - [ ] Browser zoom (90%, 100%, 110%)
   - [ ] High DPI displays

### Automated Test Coverage

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test -- MayaSideBySideFixed.desktop-viewport.test.tsx
```

Expected output:
- 25 tests should pass
- No console errors
- No layout warnings

## Known Issues & Recommendations

### Current State Assessment

Based on component analysis:
1. **Panel Structure**: Uses `w-1/2` (50%) for both panels
2. **Container**: Has `flex` and `overflow-hidden`
3. **Border**: Chat panel has `border-r` class

### Potential Improvements

1. **Add Explicit Gap**
   ```css
   .flex.overflow-hidden {
     gap: 0.5rem; /* Prevent touching panels */
   }
   ```

2. **Ensure Proper Flex Shrink**
   ```css
   .w-1\/2 {
     flex-shrink: 0; /* Prevent compression */
   }
   ```

3. **Z-Index Safety**
   ```css
   .chat-panel { z-index: 10; }
   .interactive-panel { z-index: 5; }
   ```

## Browser-Specific Considerations

### Chrome/Edge
- Test with DevTools device emulation
- Check computed styles panel
- Use Layout shift debugging

### Firefox
- Verify with Responsive Design Mode
- Check for subpixel rendering issues

### Safari
- Test on actual Mac hardware
- Check for webkit-specific flexbox issues

## Performance Metrics

Monitor during testing:
- Layout shift (CLS) < 0.1
- First contentful paint < 1.5s
- Time to interactive < 2.5s
- No memory leaks during transitions

## Accessibility Verification

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader announces panels
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Color contrast passes WCAG AA

## Sign-Off Criteria

Before marking as PASSED:
1. Zero overlap issues across all viewports
2. Smooth transitions between stages
3. No console errors or warnings
4. Performance metrics within targets
5. Accessibility requirements met
