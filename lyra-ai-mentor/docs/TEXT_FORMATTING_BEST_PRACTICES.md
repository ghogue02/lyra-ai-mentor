## ‚úÖ **ALWAYS DO THIS**: Structured Format

**Good Example:**

### Email Component Structure:
1. **Subject Line** - Highlighted background, bold formatting
2. **Greeting** - Clear separation, proper spacing
3. **Body Paragraphs** - Logical breaks, readable line spacing
4. **Closing** - Visual separator from body content
5. **Signature Block** - Distinct formatting for contact info

### Implementation Example:

```jsx
// Subject Line
<div className="font-semibold text-gray-800 bg-gray-100 px-2 py-1 rounded mb-3">
  Subject: A Quick Note of Appreciation üåª
</div>

// Greeting
<div className="font-medium text-gray-800 mb-3">
  Dear [Parent's Name],
</div>

// Body Paragraphs
<div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
  I hope this message finds you well, even amidst your busy day! I wanted to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for your continued support of Hope Gardens Community Center.
</div>

<div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
  Your involvement is what helps us create a nurturing environment for your children and all our community members.
</div>

// Closing & Signature
<div className="mt-4 pt-2 border-t border-gray-200">
  <div className="text-gray-700">Warmly,</div>
  <div className="text-gray-700">Maya Rodriguez</div>
  <div className="text-gray-700">Program Director</div>
  <div className="text-gray-700">Hope Gardens Community Center</div>
</div>

// Contact Information

</div>
```
