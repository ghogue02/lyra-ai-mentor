# PACE Email Full Content View Fix

## Problem
Users were unable to view the full content of saved PACE emails in their toolkit. The issue was:
- Email previews were truncated to 3 lines using `line-clamp-3`
- No way to view the complete email content
- Copy buttons worked but users couldn't preview what they were copying

## Solution
Added a "View" button and modal dialog to display the full email content:

### Changes Made

1. **Added View Button** (`PaceEmailCard.tsx`)
   - New "View" button in the action buttons row
   - Eye icon for clear visual indication
   - Positioned as the first button for prominence

2. **Added Full Content Modal**
   - Uses shadcn/ui Dialog component
   - Displays all email sections:
     - Why This Email Works (with framework badge)
     - AI Prompt (full prompt text)
     - Generated Email (complete email content)
   - Scrollable content area for long emails
   - Action buttons in modal footer for copying/downloading

3. **Enhanced Preview Interaction**
   - Email preview in grid view is now clickable
   - Hover effect indicates interactivity
   - "Click to view full email" hint text

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Modal adapts to screen size (max-width: 3xl)
   - Button text hidden on small screens to save space
   - Maintains usability on mobile devices

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**
   - Sections are visually separated
   - Color-coded backgrounds for different content types
   - Icons help identify each section

2. **Preserved Formatting**
   - `whitespace-pre-wrap` maintains email formatting
   - Line breaks and spacing are preserved
   - Monospace font for AI prompts

3. **Quick Actions**
   - Copy buttons directly in the modal
   - Visual feedback when content is copied
   - Download option for offline use

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to ensure:
- Full content is displayed in modal
- Copy functions work with complete content
- Preview truncation still works as expected
- Click interactions open the modal

## Technical Details
- No database changes required
- Full content already stored in metadata
- Frontend-only solution
- Backward compatible with existing saved emails
