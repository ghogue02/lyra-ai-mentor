Hi Maya,

I just saw the notice about the new 5:30 PM pickup time starting next month. As a single parent working until 6 PM downtown, I'm really concerned about how this will work for Emma and me. 

She loves the program and her friends there. Is there any flexibility? I'm worried she'll have to drop out, and I don't know what I'll do for childcare. Can we talk about options?

I'm feeling pretty stressed about this.

Thanks,
Sarah Chen`,

Maya,

I can't tell you how relieved I am! When I sent that email this morning, I was in such a panic. Your response made me feel heard and gave me real options.

The extended care program sounds perfect - I had no idea it was so affordable. And I love the idea of connecting with other downtown parents for backup coverage.

Thank you for caring about Emma and our family. This is why we love Hope Gardens so much.

Can we talk tomorrow afternoon?

Gratefully,
Sarah`,
