  // The enhanced prompt that includes all our scaffolding
  const enhancedPrompt = `You are helping Maya respond to Sarah Chen's urgent email about pickup time changes. Sarah is stressed about the new 5:30 PM pickup (she works until 6 PM downtown) and worried Emma will lose her spot.

EMOTIONAL CONTEXT: Maya feels Sarah's stress and wants to help while following policy. This is Maya's first time using AI for email - make it magical!

TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
1. OPENING: Acknowledge Sarah's concern with warmth
2. EXPLANATION: Explain the change (staff scheduling & safety protocols)  
3. SOLUTIONS: Offer these specific options:
   - Extended care until 6:30 PM ($5/day, sliding scale available)
   - Parent carpool network (matching with other downtown parents)
   - Possible work-study for Emma with younger children
4. CLOSING: Reinforce Emma's value to program and suggest a call

TONE GUIDANCE: Warm & Understanding - like a supportive friend who runs a program

KEY PHRASES TO CONSIDER:
- "I completely understand your concern"
- "Emma's place in our program is important to us"
- "We're here to find a solution together"
- "Here's what we can do together"
- "Emma is such a bright light in our program"

TRANSFORM WITH:
- Replace "can't" with possibilities
- Replace "policy" with "to ensure all children's safety"
- Add specific details about Emma to personalize
- Include emotion words that mirror Sarah's feelings
- End with clear next steps and reassurance

SUCCESS CRITERIA: Sarah should feel heard, have concrete options, and know Maya truly cares about Emma staying in the program.`

I just saw the notice about the new 5:30 PM pickup time starting next month. As a single parent working until 6 PM downtown, I'm really concerned about how this will work for Emma and me. 

She loves the program and her friends there. Is there any flexibility? I'm worried she'll have to drop out, and I don't know what I'll do for childcare. Can we talk about options?

I'm feeling pretty stressed about this.

Thanks,
Sarah Chen`
