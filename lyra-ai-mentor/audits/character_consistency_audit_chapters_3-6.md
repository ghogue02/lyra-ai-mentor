## Summary of Issues

**Total Content Blocks Analyzed:** 44 (with character references)
**Total Mismatches Found:** 13
**Error Rate:** 29.5%

### Pattern Analysis:
- Sofia appears incorrectly in 11 content blocks across chapters 4, 5, and 6
- David appears incorrectly in 1 content block in chapter 5
- This suggests Sofia's content may have been used as a template without proper character substitution

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Update Content Block IDs:** 84, 85, 86, 89, 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, 105, 107, 122, 123
2. **Replace incorrect character names** with the appropriate chapter protagonist
3. **Review character-specific details** (organization names, roles, contexts) to ensure consistency

### Quality Assurance Improvements:
1. Implement automated character consistency checks in content deployment
2. Create character reference sheets for content creators
3. Add validation rules to prevent cross-chapter character references

## Verification Query
To verify fixes, run:
```sql
SELECT cb.id, cb.title, l.chapter_id, cb.content
FROM content_blocks cb
JOIN lessons l ON cb.lesson_id = l.id  
WHERE cb.id IN (84, 85, 86, 89, 97, 98, 99, 100, 102, 105, 107, 122, 123)
ORDER BY l.chapter_id, cb.id;
```
