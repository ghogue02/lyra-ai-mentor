## 🔧 Integration Examples

### Basic Setup
```typescript
import { monitoringSystem } from '@/monitoring';

// Auto-initialize with environment detection
await monitoringSystem.initialize();
```

### Error Boundary Integration
```typescript
import { MonitoringErrorBoundary } from '@/monitoring';

<MonitoringErrorBoundary componentName="UserDashboard">
  <UserDashboard />
</MonitoringErrorBoundary>
```

### Performance Profiling
```typescript
import { withPerformanceProfiler, usePerformanceProfiler } from '@/monitoring';

// HOC approach
const ProfiledComponent = withPerformanceProfiler(MyComponent);

// Hook approach
function MyComponent() {
  const { trackError } = usePerformanceProfiler('MyComponent');
  // Component logic
}
```
