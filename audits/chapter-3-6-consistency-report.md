# Chapter 3-6 Character Consistency Audit Report
**Date**: 2025-07-03
**Auditor**: Claude Code

## Executive Summary
Audit reveals significant character mixing issues in content blocks for Chapters 4-6, while interactive elements are correctly assigned. Each chapter should follow ONE character's journey, but Sofia appears in multiple chapters where she doesn't belong.

## Character Ownership by Chapter
- **Chapter 3**: Sofia Martinez (Communication & Storytelling) ✅
- **Chapter 4**: David Kim (Data & Decision Making) ⚠️
- **Chapter 5**: Rachel Thompson (Automation & Efficiency) ⚠️
- **Chapter 6**: Alex Rivera (Organizational Transformation) ⚠️

## Detailed Findings

### Chapter 3 - Sofia Martinez ✅
**Status**: CONSISTENT
- All content blocks mention Sofia exclusively
- All interactive elements are Sofia-themed
- No character mixing detected

### Chapter 4 - David Kim ⚠️
**Status**: INCONSISTENT
- **Lesson 10**: Sofia appears 3 times (should be David)
- **Lesson 20**: Mixed - David (1), Sofia (2)
- **Lessons 30-40**: Correctly feature David
- **Interactive Elements**: All correctly assigned to David ✅

### Chapter 5 - Rachel Thompson ⚠️
**Status**: INCONSISTENT
- **Lesson 10**: Mixed - Rachel (2), David (1)
- **Lesson 20**: Mixed - Rachel (1), David (1), Sofia (1)
- **Lessons 30-40**: Correctly feature Rachel
- **Interactive Elements**: All correctly assigned to Rachel ✅

### Chapter 6 - Alex Rivera ⚠️
**Status**: HIGHLY INCONSISTENT
- **Lesson 10**: Sofia (2), Alex (1)
- **Lesson 20**: Sofia (2), Alex (1)
- **Lesson 30**: Sofia (1), Alex (2)
- **Lesson 40**: Sofia (2), Alex (1)

## Priority Issues to Fix

### Critical (Chapter 6)
- Remove all Sofia references from Alex's chapter
- Ensure Alex is the primary character throughout

### High (Chapter 4)
- Remove Sofia references from Lesson 10 and 20
- Ensure David is featured consistently

### Medium (Chapter 5)
- Remove David and Sofia references from Lessons 10 and 20
- Ensure Rachel is the sole focus

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Update content blocks to remove cross-character references
2. **Quality Check**: Each chapter should mention ONLY its assigned character
3. **Consistency**: Interactive elements are correctly assigned - use as template
