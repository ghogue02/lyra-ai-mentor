3. Fix character consistency in Chapter 6 (Alex)
4. Implement variety in element phase lengths
5. Set up automatic guideline compliance

- ✅ Updated 6 elements in Chapter 2 with phase variety:
  - 2-phase warmups: elements 68, 172, 173
  - 1-phase focused practice: elements 175, 153, 154
  - 3-phase comprehensive: elements 171, 152, 174
- ✅ Achieved good variety mix per lesson

### 11:10 - Guideline Compliance Checker Created
- ✅ Built automated compliance checking script: guideline-compliance-checker.ts
- ✅ Implemented checks for:
  - Engagement excellence (time metrics, character integration, phase variety)
  - Testing standards (test files, scripts)
  - Tone and style (formal language, jargon detection)
- ✅ Generates reports in JSON and markdown formats

### 11:15 - First Compliance Report Generated
- ✅ Ran compliance checker successfully
- ✅ Overall compliance: 25%

  - 5 guidelines need automated checks implemented
- ✅ Reports saved to /audits/

## Session Summary
All requested tasks completed successfully:
1. ✅ Fixed character consistency across chapters 4-6 (15 content blocks updated)
2. ✅ Implemented phase variety in Chapter 2 elements (6 elements updated)
3. ✅ Created and ran automated guideline compliance checker
4. ✅ Updated CONTEXT.md with completion status

## Key Improvements
- Chapters 4-6 now follow single character journeys
- Interactive elements have varied phase lengths for better engagement
- Automated compliance checking infrastructure in place
- First baseline compliance report generated (25% compliance)

## Next Session Recommendations
1. Add time metrics to more interactive elements (target: 80% coverage)
2. Implement automated checks for remaining 5 guidelines
3. Run full test suite and address any TypeScript errors
4. Consider creating more phase variety in chapters 3-6
