## Known Issues and Limitations

### Minor Issues Identified
1. **Test User Creation:** Integration tests require actual auth users (expected behavior)
2. **Migration Naming:** Some older migrations use non-standard naming (non-blocking)

### Limitations
1. **Auth Dependency:** Full testing requires Supabase Auth users
2. **Real-time Features:** WebSocket functionality not yet implemented
3. **File Uploads:** Workshop file attachment system pending

**Impact Assessment:** None of these issues affect core Chapter 7 functionality.
